		<p>Here's where you can read about our school and find out more about us. We're a very musical famiy as you can see further down, from little Saoirse at age 9 to mammy Deenie, a good bit older than age 9!</p>
			<h2>Musicland - Classes</h2>
		<p>We offer instrumental lessons in Piano, Violin and Guitar and musicianship and theory classes.</p>
		<p>The Musicianship classes are for kids aged 0 to 8 years old. The children we teach usually start on an instrument at age six. We also offer lessons to older children but this usually requires that the child completes a few months of musicianship classes first.</p>

		<p><u>Róisín</u>: I play Piano and Saxaphone. I just completed my Masters in Mathematics but I am currently taking a break to check in on the kids in Musicland. I assist for the musicianship classes and also teach piano. I am particularly interested in finding effective ways to teach music theory to young children.</p>
		
		<img src = "group-pics/Aine.jpg" alt = "Áine" style = "width: 229px; height: 300px;">
		
		<p><u>Áine</u>: My degree is in music and anthropology. I am currently doing a year in Abu Dhabi teaching music in primary school. Before this I taught piano for musicland and assisted in the musicianship classes. I particularly enjoy working with very young children and children with special needs and I am developing an interest in Music Therapy.</p>
