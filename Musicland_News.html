			 <h1 class="news-heading">"Official recognition of the Colour Strings Method in Ireland" </h1>
			 
			 <p>The Colour Strings method of music tuition in Ireland is officially recognised within the educational system. At a short musical performance by the children of 'Musicland' School of Music, Department officials paid tribute to the children who had performed a rendition of Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'  for them". They described Colour Strings as the way forward in the initial musical education of young children. Colour Strings is a fun method of introducing children to music without delving straight into the more daunting world of music theory</p>
