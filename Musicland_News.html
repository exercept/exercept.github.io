			 the Colour Strings method of music tuition in Ireland"

			 The Education Minister, Richard Bruton paid tribute to the 
			 children who had performed a rendition of Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'  for him". 
			 He described Colour Strings as the way forward in 
			 the initial musical education of young children. 
			 Colour Strings is a fun method of introducing children to music
			 without delving straight into the more daunting world of music theory"--> </p>
