			 <h1>"Department of Education officially recognises Colour Strings Method in Ireland" </h1>
			 <p> "The Department of Education has formally recognised
			 the Colour Strings method of music tuition in Ireland"
			 At a short musical performance by the children of 'Musicland' School of Music,
			 The Education Minister, Richard Bruton paid tribute to the 
			 children who had performed a rendition of Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'  for him". 
			 He described Colour Strings as the way forward in 
			 the initial musical education of young children. 
			 Colour Strings is a fun method of introducing children to music
			 without delving straight into the more daunting world of music theory" </p>
