				<h1> Classes at Musicland</h1>
				<p> Musicland provides classes across a range of musical instruments to children as young as four
				up to about twelve. Classes are run in the evenings and on Saturdays. Wind instruments are 
				particularly popular and due to popular demand, we plan to hire a part-time clarinet tutor for Saturday 
				classes. Most instruments can be catered for and we have just hired a specialist percussion teacher.
				Hopefully students won't keep the neighbours up all night!
				If you have children who are interested in enrolling drop by the school any day of the week and we will
				give you a tour of the building. We may even put on an impromptuo concert while you are here!</p>
